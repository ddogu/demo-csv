# demo-csv
Repo for the coursera lecture

In this Jupyter notebook we open a given CSV file using the pandas module creating a dataframe. Then we define three masks according to the contents of the file.
Finally we use these masks to filter out all non-essential data, convert the dataframe to JSON and dump the JSON to a local file.
